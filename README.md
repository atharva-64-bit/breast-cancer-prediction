Got it! You're trying to run a Streamlit app on **your computer**, but the virtual environment (`venv`) and launcher were set up on **a different computer**, which causes the `streamlit` command to break due to invalid paths (like pointing to `C:\users\traya\...`).

Here’s how to **fix this cleanly on your computer** 👇

---

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Fix (Recreate `venv` Locally)**

Since the `venv` was created on another computer, you **must recreate it on your own** to match your system paths.

### 🧹 1. **Delete the old `venv` folder**

In your project folder:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force venv
```

Or just delete the `venv` folder manually using File Explorer.

---

### 🔁 2. **Create a fresh virtual environment on your PC**

Still in the project folder:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

This creates a new `venv` locally in:

```
C:\Users\Atharva\OneDrive\Documents\coding\codebasics ml course\breast-cancer-prediction\venv
```

---

### ⚡ 3. **Activate the new virtual environment**

```powershell
& "venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1"
```

Your terminal should show `(venv)` again.

---

### 📦 4. **Install Streamlit and other dependencies**

If you have a `requirements.txt`, use:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, just install Streamlit:

```powershell
pip install streamlit
```

(And any other libraries your project needs)

---

### 🚀 5. **Run the app**

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

If you face the same launcher error again, use the alternative:

```powershell
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

---

Let me know if you want help generating the `requirements.txt` file or copying files from your other computer properly.
